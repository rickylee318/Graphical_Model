# Graphical_Model

### Motivation

Traditionally, portfolio allocation is a two step approach, which provides unstable and exterme cases depending on the first stage estimation. Thus, in order to maintain the stabel and extract useful dependence, here I apply several graphical models in order to rule out redundant covariance and extract real useful information, such as Graphical lasso, LedoitWolf and Concord.
